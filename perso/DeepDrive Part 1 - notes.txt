-----
Variables conventions:
_xxx (internal / private object)
  ** will not be imported with "from xxx import *"
  
__xxx - unsed to mangle ckass attributes - useful in inheritance

__xxx__ system-defined names - Don't use!

Look at "PEP 8" style guide
Packages: short, all lowercase
Modules: short, all lowercase
Classes: CamelCase
Functions, variables: snake_case
Constants: MIN_APR (All uppercase, underscores)

-----   
No switch/case in Pyton!! Use if/elif/else
if/else one-liner:
X if condition else Y

-----
def my_func(a: int):
the type is only indicating

Lambdas:
f = lambda x: x**2


-----
do while:
while True:
    code block
    if xxx :
        break
        
while xxx:
    code block
else:
    code block executed only if no "break" was encountered
   
----
try...except...finally
finally always executes, even if there was a "continue" or "break" before

----
for loops are for "iterables"
for i in iterable
while loop is closer to C++ for loops
for can have "else" as for while loops
automatic indexing:
for i in len(iterable):
    print (i, iterable[i])
    
for i, c in enumerate(iterable):
    print (i, c)
    
-----
hex(id(xxx)) # Gives the address of xxx
orverload str: __str__
Representation __repr__ - Standard is to show how constructor was called.
overload ==: __eq__
  Always check type also with instance (not type, because it will not handle subclasses)
  if instance(other, Rectangle)
Others: __lt__, __gt__, __ne__, __lte__
PAs besoin dImplémenter lt et gt, Python va faire l'invese automatiquement.

Important: when adding attributes to a class, think if you should encapsulate with getters/setters at the beginning...

Instance methods:
@property
def _xxx(self):
   return self._property
@xxx.setter
def xxx(self, value):
   self._property = value
